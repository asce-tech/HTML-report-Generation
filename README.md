# Project Name 
# HTML-report-Generation
IQR Outlier Detection, Data Splitting, and HTML Report Generation

## Objective
Developed a Python program that takes a CSV file as input, performs the Interquartile Range (IQR) outlier analysis 
Detection on a specified column, and splits the dataset into outliers and non-outliers. This program will generate an HTML report that contains: the name of the file, column index (and column name if there is a header), summary statistics, histograms, and boxplots for the original, outlier, and non-outlier subsets. Outlier and non-outlier subsets of the dataset must be saved as separate CSV files. 

### Skills Learned

- Learned how to analyze CSV files using Python code
- Developed a command-line tool to tackle dataset preprocessing and outlier analysis efficiently.
- Experience with loading, processing, and exporting data in CSV format.
- Ability to calculate key statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and IQR.
- Skilled in handling data through libraries like pandas and numpy.
- Created histograms and boxplots to visually analyze data subsets, demonstrating understanding of data visualization principles.
- Developed dynamic HTML reports programmatically using Python, incorporating data summaries and visualizations.

### Libraries Used

- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
- sys for system-specific parameters and functions.
- Numpy for numerical computations.
- Jinja2 for creating dynamic web pages and rendering text files.
- Matplotlib for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

### Steps
- Start by importing essential libraries
- Command-Line Argument Handling
- Read the CSV File
- Extract the Specified Column
- Perform IQR Outlier Detection
- Calculate Summary Statistics
- Save Outliers and Non-Outliers to CSV
- Generate Histograms and Boxplots
- Generate an HTML Report
- Save CSV Files
